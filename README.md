# We All Die

> *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."* — Psalm 90:12 (NIV)

Welcome to **We All Die**, a web-based tool that visualizes your life in weeks—past, present, and future--the goal is to encourage thoughtful stewardship of the days we’re given.

## How to Use

1. **Open the App**: Load `index.html` in your browser—no installation required.
2. **Enter Your Details**:
   - Select your **birth date**.
   - Choose your **biological sex** (male or female).
3. **Generate Your Calendar**: Click "Generate Calendar" to view your life in weeks:
   - Blue dots = past weeks.
   - Red dot = current week.
   - Gray dots = future weeks.
   - Yellow line = average life expectancy.
   - Orange line = median life expectancy.
4. **Explore**: Hover over weeks for age details, and save your calendar as an image with "Save as Image".

## Using the Tool

This app provides an opportunity to reflect on time as a resource entrusted to us by God (Ephesians 5:16). Consider these steps:
- **Pray** and **Listen**: Read God's words and pray them back.
- **Reflect**: Your time is not your own.
- **Plan**: Think about specific, concrete ways to serve God.

## Note

- **Life Expectancy Data**: Based on simplified US statistics (males: average 76, median 78; females: average 81, median 83). These are estimates—God determines our actual lifespan.
- **Calendar Span**: Displays 90 years as a practical framework, though lifespans vary. Each life has a purpose known to God (Psalm 139:16).
