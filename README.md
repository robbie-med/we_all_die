# We All Die

> *"Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom."* — Psalm 90:12 (NIV)

Welcome to **We All Die**, a web-based tool that visualizes your life in weeks—past, present, and future--the goal is to encourage thoughtful stewardship of the days we’re given.

## How to Use

1. **Open the App**: Load `index.html` in your browser—no installation required.
2. **Enter Your Details**:
   - Select your **birth date**.
   - Choose your **biological sex** (male or female).
3. **Generate Your Calendar**: Click "Generate Calendar" to view your life in weeks:
   - Blue dots = past weeks.
   - Red dot = current week.
   - Gray dots = future weeks.
   - Yellow line = average life expectancy.
   - Orange line = median life expectancy.
4. **Explore**: Hover over weeks for age details, and save your calendar as an image with "Save as Image".

## Using the App for Spiritual Growth

This app provides an opportunity to reflect on time as a resource entrusted to us by God (Ephesians 5:16). Consider these steps:
- **Pray**: Seek wisdom to use your days well.
- **Reflect**: Evaluate how your time can glorify God and benefit others.
- **Plan**: Think about ways to serve His purposes, such as through relationships or sharing your faith.

The calendar uses statistical life expectancies, but Scripture reminds us: *"You do not know what tomorrow will bring... If the Lord wills, we will do this or that"* (James 4:14-15). Our trust rests in God’s sovereign plan.

## Important Considerations

- **Life Expectancy Data**: Based on simplified US statistics (males: average 76, median 78; females: average 81, median 83). These are estimates—God determines our actual lifespan.
- **Calendar Span**: Displays 90 years as a practical framework, though lifespans vary. Each life has a purpose known to God (Psalm 139:16).

## Note on Life Expectancy Data

The app relies on approximate US life expectancy figures. These may not apply universally due to personal, cultural, or global factors. Use them as a reference, trusting God’s timing above all.

## Note on Calendar Span

The 90-year span is an arbitrary choice for visualization. Some lives are shorter, others longer—each is uniquely designed by God for His glory.
